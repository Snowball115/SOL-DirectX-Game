# SOL-DirectX-Game
 
This project was created as an assignment, during the time at the university for the DirectX course.
It should help to understand the basic processes of a DirectX game engine.
Here a game concept was thought up, in my case I took a Pokemon focused gameplay.
The player interacts with a monster on the field (represented here by pointy spheres), which allows him to enter a battle mode and fight the enemy.
Collectibles can be collected on the field, which can heal the monster in battle.
